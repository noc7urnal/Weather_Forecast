# 5 Day Weather Forecast App

## Task

Please build a one page application displaying a 5 day weather forecast for a location.  The data might look something like the information provided by [http://openweathermap.org/forecast5](http://openweathermap.org/forecast5) - The web framework used. Use ES6/HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript to create your solution. You are free to use whatever frameworks and such that you like.

You should:
* Give some thought to what will make for a good user experience.
* Ensure your code works on the following browsers (only needs to support the last two major versions for each browser): Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer
* Produce a responsive page
* Please ensure that what you do implement is good quality code using best practices and runs without any bugs, crashes or issues
* Be prepared to discuss any tradeoffs and/or compromises you make

Please upload your code to GitHub (https://github.com) - you can create a free account if needed. Please make sure the GitHub project is public and respond back to us with the URL for the project.
 
All submissions should be viewable standalone on standard browsers and can also be hosted by yourself if you like. Any environment or build steps required should be documented in a README markdown file.  Installation of global packages is discouraged.
 
Good luck and thank you for your time - we look forward to seeing your creation.
